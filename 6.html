<!-- Write a program in Java Script which should prompt the user to enter the result of Question- What is the 
result of 10+10?‖. The user will be given a chance to answer the question. If the answer is correct then 
the program should raise a message-―Congratulations‖. If the answer is wrong then the program 
should again ask the same question. If the answer is correct then the message should be –―Cleared in 
the second round‖ else another message should be generated specifying –― Sorry, try next time‖ and the 
program should exit. Note – Make use of If. Else.  -->
